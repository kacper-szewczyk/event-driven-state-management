# Optimization - logic layer

- Data management: data fetching, manipulation, and storage. 
- User input handling: user interactions such as button clicks, form submissions, or keyboard input. 
- Business logic: the rules and algorithms that govern the application's behavior. This includes performing calculations, executing conditional statements, and applying validation or business rules to ensure data integrity.
- Event handling: The logic layer manages event-driven programming, responding to events triggered by the user, the system, or other components.
- State management: managing the state transitions, updating the UI components accordingly, and ensuring data consistency throughout the application.

# Optimization - Render layer

- Rendering UI components: the appropriate HTML markup, applying CSS styles, and positioning the components on the screen.

- Updating UI based on state: re-renders the affected UI components to reflect these changes, ensuring that the UI remains synchronized with the underlying data and logic.

- Handling UI events: listens for user interactions, such as clicks, mouse movements, or touch events. It captures these events and triggers the corresponding actions in the logic layer. 

- Styling and layout: applies CSS styles to the UI components to control their appearance, including colors, fonts, sizes, margins, and positioning. 

- Responsiveness: It employs responsive design techniques, such as media queries or flexible layouts, to ensure that the UI is accessible and usable across various devices and screen resolutions.
